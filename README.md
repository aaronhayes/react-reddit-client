# Tanda Reddit Coding Challenge
[See Task Here][1]

## Installation
We need `node` installed before we can do anything. Now lets install the
node modules.
```
$ npm install
```

## Set Reddit API KEY
Generate a [Anonymous 1 Hour  Token][2] and set the
`REACT_APP_REDDIT_ACCESS_TOKEN` within the `.env` file. Node if this token
expires we have to restart the node development server (see below).

## Running Node Development Server
Simple run the node dev server. This should open a browser to
[Reddit Clone](http://localhost:8080).
```
$ npm start
```

## Technical Discussion


## Potential Improvements
### UI/UX
I didn't spend much time designiner the UI/UX for the "reddit clone". I don't
consider myself a desiginer, so without some guidance on what the experience
should be I'm somewhat lost. But given an outline of what it should look like
I'd be able to deliver.

I took this challenge as a way to layout React code rather than UI/UX test.

### Extensions
I didn't complete all the extensions on the task due to time constraints.
